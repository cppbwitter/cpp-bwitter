# Bwitter shutdown and updates (important)  
As of 18 October 2021, bwitter.me has been down and permenantly shut down. The source code has also been released by Yuki(developer of bwitter).  
Future releases of cpp-bwitter are uncertain, probably being put on a halt since the official site is down.  
As such, consider this commit on 28 October 2021 as the last release of cpp-bwitter as a whole.  

# CPP-BWITTER
